# Request for Comments (RFC)

## Outline
Request for Comments (RFC) is a process available to anyone at Dreams to help identify and resolve the following challenges:

- Primary Responsibility
- Overall alignment
- Clear timelines
- Discussion
- Traceability

RFCs can be used for anything from technical specifications of our services and systems, to creating office policies and guidebooks that require collaboration. See [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) for more details.

If properly used, the RFC process is a very powerful tool.

## Submitting Your First RFC
The simple outline of applying the RFC process is:

1) Clone this repository
2) Create a new branch
3) Copy `rfc-templates/000-rfc-template.md` to `rfc-documents/` and rename it properly â€“ keeping the numbering convention
4) Work on your document
5) Create a pull request containing the changes
6) Invite people to discuss
7) Once the satisfactory document is created, remember to set **Resolution** (we start with **Open**, of course)
