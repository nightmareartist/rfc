#### Open Questions - The Unknown Knowns

#### Document status

**Active** :: Document is in active state and is used as a point of reference. If this document supersedes another document link here to the old document.

**Deprecated** :: Document is deprecated and replaced with a new version or another document. Link here to the new document.

**NOTE** :: Deciding whether a document should be deprecated or just updated is something that should be decided through a PR process. We can't cover all the potential scenarios so PR is the best path to make this decision.

#### Resolution

The state of the RFC:

**Open** :: Review in progress.

**Closed** :: A resolution have been reached. If there is no obvious consensus or if the RFC contains several proposed solutions - write down why the decision was made.

**Rejected** :: The RFC is not relevant anymore. Also write down /why/.
